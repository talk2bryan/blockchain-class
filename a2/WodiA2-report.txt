Report on the simulation for this assignment:

From running the simulation where the number of inputs per transaction was 1, we 
had to progressively increase the value x to get closer and closer to 2500 UTXOs
by the 125th block. The value of x after multiple simulations got closer to 7%

After increasing the value of each transaction input from a sample distribution
centred along 2, we find that we never got anything near 2500 UTXOs at the 125th 
block. On average, we got closer to 2500 UTXOs at the 635.2th block with a value
of x closer to 0.10% 

Conclusion:
With one input, we need to spend more proportions of UTXOs in order to get to 
2500 with limited blocks, i.e. 25 blocks in (a). Whereas, with more blocks in the
blockchain, we can reach 2500 as long as we allow multiple inputs.
